# Story 4.2: Develop Core Monitoring & Metrics Collection

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **collect key performance metrics and operational data from the AI Gateway**,

- so that **I can monitor system health, performance, and usage trends in real-time**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Metrics are collected for LLM request latency, success rates, and error rates per provider/model.

2. Metrics are collected for caching effectiveness (hit/miss ratio).

3. Metrics are collected for intelligent router decision counts (e.g., how often each model is selected, routing strategy applied).

4. These metrics are exposed via a standard interface (e.g., a Prometheus endpoint for pull-based collection, or a push mechanism to a monitoring service).

5. Basic alerts can be configured based on predefined thresholds for critical metrics (e.g., high error rate for a specific LLM provider, significant latency spikes).

6. The implementation adheres to the Python and TypeScript coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: Metrics can be observed from a local endpoint or log output, demonstrating their collection and basic formatting.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Research and select a metrics collection library (e.g., Prometheus client library, StatsD client) for Python services.

- [ ] Implement metric instrumentation within core gateway services (Unified LLM API, Intelligent Router, Optimization Service) for key performance indicators (latency, success/error rates).

- [ ] Collect metrics specifically for caching effectiveness (hits, misses) within the caching mechanism.

- [ ] Instrument the `intelligent-router` service to collect counts of routing decisions per model/strategy.

- [ ] Expose a `/metrics` endpoint or configure a push mechanism to make collected metrics available.

- [ ] Define initial alert rules based on critical thresholds (e.g., error rate > X%).

- [ ] Write unit tests for metric instrumentation and collection logic.

- [ ] Create a simple test script to verify metric exposure.

- [ ] Document metric definitions, collection methods, and alert configurations in the relevant service READMEs.

## Dev Technical Guidance

Metrics collection is essential for understanding the operational health and performance of the AI Gateway, forming the basis for proactive monitoring.

- **Dependencies:** This story relies on the operational data generated by services implemented in Epic 1, 2, and 3. It also complements Story 4.1 (Centralized Logging).

- **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI. Metrics will be collected within the relevant backend services.

- **Observability:** This story is a core component of "Epic 4: Observability & Analytics Dashboard." The collected metrics will feed into the dashboard. Refer to "Monitoring & Observability" in the Architecture Document for guidance on key metrics.

- **Performance Impact:** Metric collection should be lightweight and not introduce significant overhead to the critical path of LLM requests.

- **Alerting:** While full alerting systems are beyond this story, defining the basic rules here is crucial.
