# Story 1.1: Set Up Core API Gateway (Kong)

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **deploy and configure Kong as the outermost API gateway layer**,

- so that **it can manage all incoming API traffic, including LLM calls, provide basic security, and handle rate limiting**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Kong Gateway is deployed and accessible.

2. A basic route is configured in Kong to forward requests to an internal service (placeholder for LLM gateway).

3. Basic rate limiting is enabled and demonstrable on a test route.

4. Initial security configurations (e.g., basic API key authentication) are in place.

5. The deployment aligns with the specified infrastructure requirements for containerization (Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes/Kuma if applicable), as outlined in the Architecture Document.

6. The deployment adheres to the monorepo structure, with Kong configurations placed in `infra/kong/` or `services/kong-gateway/` as per the Project Structure in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: Basic API calls through Kong can be verified via command-line tools (e.g., `curl`) from the local development environment.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Research and select an appropriate deployment method for Kong (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud-specific marketplace deployment).

- [ ] Set up Kong's database (PostgreSQL is the primary choice as per Architecture Document).

- [ ] Deploy Kong Gateway instance(s).

- [ ] Configure a basic service and route in Kong to proxy requests to a dummy or placeholder upstream service.

- [ ] Implement a basic rate limiting plugin on the configured route.

- [ ] Implement an authentication plugin (e.g., Key Auth) and configure a test consumer.

- [ ] Verify Kong is accessible and responsive via its admin and proxy ports.

- [ ] Write unit tests for Kong configuration files (if using declarative config).

- [ ] Document deployment steps and basic verification commands in a README within the Kong service directory.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story establishes the critical entry point for all API traffic, so a robust and secure setup is paramount.

- **Technology Stack:** Kong is the mandated API Gateway. PostgreSQL is the primary database choice.

- **Infrastructure:** The deployment should align with the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) requirement and integrate with the monorepo's `infra/` directory. Consider using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes/Kuma for orchestration, as per the Architecture Document.

    - **Environment Variables:** Consider environment variables for Kong configuration (e.g., `KONG_DATABASE`, `KONG_PG_HOST`, `KONG_PG_USER`).

- **Security:** Pay close attention to "Security Best Practices" in the Architecture Document, specifically API security controls, rate limiting, and authentication/authorization. Ensure API keys are securely managed and never hardcoded.

- **Error Handling:** Ensure Kong's error responses are clear and don't leak sensitive information, aligning with the "Error Handling Strategy".

- **Testing:** Implement unit tests for Kong configurations (if declarative). Manually verify functionality using `curl` or Postman. Ensure rate limits and authentication are correctly enforced.

- **Performance:** While full performance testing comes later, ensure initial setup doesn't introduce obvious bottlenecks.
