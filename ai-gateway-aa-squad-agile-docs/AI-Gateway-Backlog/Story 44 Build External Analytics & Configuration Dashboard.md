# Story 4.4: Build External Analytics & Configuration Dashboard

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **build an intuitive external dashboard (using Next.js as frontend UI)**,

- so that **I can visualize the collected logs, metrics, and traces, and manage gateway configurations (providers, virtual keys, routing rules)**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A Next.js application serves as the external dashboard, integrated into the monorepo within the `dashboard/` directory.

2. The dashboard provides visualizations for LLM usage, cost, and performance metrics (from Story 4.2).

3. Users can view logs and trace data, with filtering capabilities (from Story 4.1 & 4.3).

4. The dashboard includes an interface for configuring LLM inference providers and managing virtual keys.

5. The dashboard allows configuration of intelligent routing rules and optimization parameters.

6. All components of the dashboard are aggregated into one cohesive view, possibly leveraging embedded iframes or a unified component model as per Frontend Architecture.

7. The dashboard adheres to the Next.js and TypeScript coding standards defined in the Architecture Document and Frontend Architecture Document.

8. The dashboard implements authentication and authorization as defined in the Architecture Document for secure access.

9. The dashboard is responsive and accessible, aiming for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as per Frontend Architecture.

10. Local testability: The dashboard can be run locally, connect to the local gateway services, and display test data.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up a new Next.js application within the `dashboard/` directory, adhering to the specified frontend directory structure.

- [ ] Implement core dashboard layout and navigation (e.g., using `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`).

- [ ] Implement authentication/authorization flows for dashboard access, integrating with the gateway's internal API.

- [ ] Develop API client services (`src/services/gatewayApi.ts`) to fetch data from the gateway's internal metrics, logs, and tracing APIs (from Story 4.1, 4.2, 4.3).

- [ ] Implement UI components and pages for visualizing LLM usage, cost, and performance metrics (e.g., `src/app/dashboard/metrics/page.tsx`, `src/components/charts/LineChart.tsx`).

- [ ] Implement UI components and pages for viewing logs and traces with basic filtering and search.

- [ ] Develop UI components and pages for managing LLM inference providers (configuration), virtual keys (create/manage), and intelligent routing rules (configuration).

- [ ] Implement state management logic (Zustand or Redux Toolkit) for dashboard data and user interactions.

- [ ] Ensure all dashboard components adhere to styling (Tailwind CSS) and component naming/organization conventions.

- [ ] Write unit tests for dashboard components and services using Jest/Vitest.

- [ ] Write E2E tests using Playwright for critical user journeys (e.g., login, viewing metrics, managing virtual keys).

- [ ] Document dashboard setup, configuration, and feature usage in the `dashboard/` README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is the culmination of the observability epic, providing the human interface for the AI Gateway. Focus on intuitive design, efficient data visualization, and robust configuration management.

- **Dependencies:** This story **depends heavily on Epic 1** (for the core gateway functionality), **Epic 4 stories 4.1, 4.2, 4.3** (for logs, metrics, traces APIs), and **Epic 5** (for virtual key and prompt management APIs). It relies on the internal APIs provided by the gateway services.

- **Technology Stack:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (for styling), and a chosen state management solution (Zustand or Redux Toolkit). It will consume the Python/FastAPI internal APIs.

- **UI/UX:** Adhere strictly to the "User Interaction and Design Goals" in the PRD, especially regarding intuitiveness and the unified view. Leverage the "Frontend Architecture Document" for guidance on component architecture, styling, and state management.

- **API Interaction:** Use the `gatewayApi.ts` service to interact with the gateway's internal APIs. Ensure efficient data fetching, possibly using React Query or SWR for server state management.

- **Data Visualization:** Select appropriate charting libraries compatible with React/Next.js for displaying metrics and trends.

- **Security:** Implement robust authentication and authorization for dashboard access as per the Architecture Document and Frontend Architecture Document. Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in the UI or logs.

- **Performance:** Optimize frontend rendering performance, especially for large datasets in log/metrics tables. Consider virtualization for large lists.

- **Accessibility:** Implement accessibility requirements as detailed in the Frontend Architecture Document.
