# Story 3.1: Implement Automatic Retries for LLM Calls

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **configure the AI Gateway to automatically retry failed LLM calls**,

- so that **transient network errors or temporary provider issues do not immediately result in a failed request**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The unified LLM API (Portkey/LiteLLM) or routing layer (Not Diamond/RouteLLM) can detect a failed LLM call.

2. The system automatically retries the failed call a configurable number of times.

3. A configurable delay (e.g., exponential backoff) is applied between retries.

4. Requests that exhaust all retries are properly logged as failures.

5. Demonstrate a scenario where a transient failure is successfully recovered by a retry.

6. The implementation adheres to the Python coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: A simple test utility or script can be run to simulate transient failures and verify retry behavior.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Identify appropriate retry libraries or implement custom retry logic (e.g., using a decorator).

- [ ] Integrate retry mechanism within the `unified-llm-api` service or the `intelligent-router` service.

- [ ] Define configurable parameters for retries (max attempts, initial delay, backoff factor).

- [ ] Implement logic to detect specific failure types (e.g., network errors, 429 Too Many Requests, 5xx server errors) that should trigger retries.

- [ ] Enhance logging to record retry attempts and final outcomes (success after retry, exhausted retries).

- [ ] Write unit tests for the retry logic, including successful retries and eventual failures.

- [ ] Create a simple test script to demonstrate retry functionality.

- [ ] Document retry configuration and behavior in the relevant service README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is crucial for improving the gateway's resilience to transient issues with LLM providers.

- **Dependencies:** This story implicitly relies on **Epic 1: Core Gateway Infrastructure & Unified Access** (Unified LLM API).

- **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI. The retry mechanism will integrate with either the `unified-llm-api` service or the `intelligent-router` service.

- **Error Handling:** Implement retry policies and handle various external API error codes (e.g., 429, 5xx) as per the "Error Handling Strategy" in the Architecture Document. Use configurable max retries and exponential backoff.

- **Observability:** Ensure comprehensive logging of retry attempts and outcomes. This is vital for monitoring gateway reliability. Refer to "Centralized Logging" in the Architecture Document.

- **Testing:** Focus on simulating transient failures to ensure the retry logic functions as expected.
