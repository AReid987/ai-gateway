# Story 2.3: Integrate OptiLLM for Fine-Tuning

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **integrate OptiLLM into the routing layer**,

- so that **the gateway can fine-tune model selection and parameters for specific tasks, further optimizing performance and cost**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. OptiLLM is integrated into the monorepo within the `services/optimization-service/` directory, following the project structure outlined in the Architecture Document.

2. The `optimization-service` can receive a request (e.g., from the Intelligent Router Service) and generate optimized model parameters or recommend a specific model.

3. The Intelligent Router Service (from Story 2.1) successfully uses OptiLLM's recommendations to adjust the LLM call parameters or model selection.

4. Demonstrate a scenario where OptiLLM's intervention improves a specific outcome (e.g., reduces tokens used, improves response relevance, lowers cost for a given quality).

5. Logging captures OptiLLM's recommendations and their impact on the final LLM call, adhering to centralized logging standards.

6. The implementation adheres to the Python coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: A test utility or script can be run to simulate requests and verify that OptiLLM processes them and the router applies the fine-tuned parameters/selection correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Integrate OptiLLM into the `services/optimization-service/` directory.

- [ ] Implement a service within `optimization-service` that exposes an API for receiving requests and providing optimized parameters or model recommendations.

- [ ] Configure OptiLLM with initial optimization strategies (e.g., parameter adjustments for specific task types).

- [ ] Modify the Intelligent Router Service (from Story 2.1 and 2.2) to integrate with the new `optimization-service`.

- [ ] Ensure the router correctly interprets and applies the optimization recommendations from OptiLLM.

- [ ] Develop test cases to verify the end-to-end flow from router to optimizer to LLM call.

- [ ] Update the logging mechanism in the router/optimization service to include OptiLLM's specific recommendations and their observed effect.

- [ ] Write unit tests for the `optimization-service`'s logic and its integration with the router.

- [ ] Create a simple test script or CLI command to demonstrate OptiLLM's influence on LLM calls.

- [ ] Document API client setup and optimization configuration steps in a README within the `optimization-service` directory.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story addresses the advanced optimization aspect of the AI Gateway, directly impacting cost and performance efficiency.

- **Dependencies:** This story **depends on Story 2.1: Implement Core Intelligent Model Router (Not Diamond/RouteLLM)** and **Story 2.2: Develop Cost & Performance Optimization Rules**. It also implicitly relies on **Epic 1** for foundational LLM access.

- **Technology Stack:** OptiLLM, Python, and FastAPI.

- **Optimization Logic:** OptiLLM's fine-tuning might involve adjusting LLM parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p, max_tokens) dynamically, or even making granular model selection suggestions based on specific prompt characteristics or historical performance data.

- **Integration with Router:** The communication between the `intelligent-router` and `optimization-service` must be efficient.

- **Observability Impact:** Detailed logging of OptiLLM's actions and their resulting LLM call parameters is critical for validating and improving its effectiveness. Refer to "Observability & Analytics Dashboard" Epic in PRD and "Logging," "Monitoring & Metrics Collection," and "Distributed Tracing" in Architecture Document.

- **Performance:** The optimization process itself should not introduce significant latency.

- **Complexity:** This is flagged in the Architecture Document as an area of "high technical complexity" requiring deeper architectural investigation or spikes.
