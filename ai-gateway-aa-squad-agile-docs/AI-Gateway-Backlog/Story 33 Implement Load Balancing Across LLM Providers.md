# Story 3.3: Implement Load Balancing Across LLM Providers

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **configure the AI Gateway to distribute LLM requests across multiple healthy providers**,

- so that **usage is optimized, rate limits are managed, and overall throughput is increased**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The routing layer (Intelligent Router Service) supports distributing incoming LLM requests across a configurable pool of healthy LLM providers.

2. At least two configurable load balancing strategies (e.g., round-robin, least-connections, weighted) are available and can be selected.

3. The system intelligently considers provider health and current load when distributing requests, ensuring requests are not sent to failing or overloaded providers.

4. Demonstrate requests being distributed across multiple LLM providers according to the selected strategy.

5. The system actively monitors and prevents individual providers from hitting their rate limits due to aggregated traffic (e.g., by intelligent distribution or active rate limit awareness).

6. The implementation adheres to the Python coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: A simple test utility or script can be run to simulate traffic and verify request distribution across mocked providers.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Research and select appropriate load balancing algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least-connections, weighted random).

- [ ] Implement configuration for a pool of LLM providers within the `intelligent-router` service.

- [ ] Implement logic for selected load balancing strategies within the `intelligent-router` service.

- [ ] Integrate provider health checks (from Story 3.2) into the load balancing decision-making process.

- [ ] Develop logic to actively monitor provider rate limits and adjust distribution to prevent exceeding them.

- [ ] Enhance logging to include details about load balancing decisions and provider utilization.

- [ ] Write unit tests for the load balancing logic, covering different strategies and provider health scenarios.

- [ ] Create a simple test script to demonstrate request distribution across multiple providers.

- [ ] Document load balancing configuration and strategies in the `intelligent-router` service README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story optimizes the utilization of multiple LLM providers, directly impacting cost and throughput while managing rate limits proactively.

- **Dependencies:** This story **depends on Story 2.1: Implement Core Intelligent Model Router (Not Diamond/RouteLLM)** (for the routing layer) and **Story 3.2: Develop Fallback Mechanism for LLM Providers** (for provider health checks). It also implicitly relies on **Epic 1** for foundational LLM access.

- **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI. The load balancing mechanism will primarily be implemented within the `intelligent-router` service.

- **Routing Logic Refinement:** The router's decision process will further incorporate load balancing considerations, becoming more sophisticated. This ties into the "Strategy Pattern" mentioned in the Architecture Document.

- **Rate Limit Management:** Proactive rate limit management is key. This might involve tracking internal counters or relying on signals from Portkey/LiteLLM if they offer such features.

- **Observability:** Comprehensive logging of load balancing decisions, provider utilization, and rate limit adherence is critical for validating and improving efficiency. Refer to "Centralized Logging" and "Monitoring & Metrics Collection" in the Architecture Document.

- **Performance:** The load balancing decision itself should be highly performant, as it is on the critical path of every LLM request.
