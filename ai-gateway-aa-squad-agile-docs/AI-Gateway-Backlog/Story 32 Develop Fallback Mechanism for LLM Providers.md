# Story 3.2: Develop Fallback Mechanism for LLM Providers

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **configure the AI Gateway to seamlessly fallback to an alternative LLM provider when a primary provider fails or is unavailable**,

- so that **LLM interactions remain uninterrupted**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. The routing layer (Intelligent Router Service) can reliably identify an unresponsive or failing primary LLM provider.

2. The system automatically switches to a predefined fallback LLM provider for the same request when the primary fails.

3. The fallback mechanism handles requests transparently to the calling application, returning a valid response from the fallback provider.

4. Successful fallback events are clearly logged, and primary provider failures are logged and alerted, adhering to centralized logging and monitoring standards.

5. Demonstrate a scenario where a primary provider is made unavailable, and a request is successfully handled by a fallback provider.

6. The implementation adheres to the Python coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: A simple test utility or script can be run to simulate primary provider failures and verify the fallback mechanism.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Define a configuration for fallback providers within the `intelligent-router` service, specifying primary-fallback relationships.

- [ ] Implement health checks or failure detection logic within the `intelligent-router` to identify unresponsive primary LLM providers.

- [ ] Modify the routing logic (from Story 2.1) to incorporate fallback behavior: if the primary provider fails, attempt the configured fallback provider.

- [ ] Ensure the request context (e.g., prompt, parameters) is correctly transferred to the fallback provider.

- [ ] Implement logging for fallback events, including the primary provider that failed and the fallback provider used.

- [ ] Configure alerting for primary LLM provider failures.

- [ ] Write unit tests for the fallback logic, covering primary failure and successful fallback scenarios.

- [ ] Create a simple test script to demonstrate fallback functionality.

- [ ] Document fallback configuration and behavior in the `intelligent-router` service README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is critical for achieving high availability, ensuring LLM interactions persist even when a provider experiences issues.

- **Dependencies:** This story **depends on Story 2.1: Implement Core Intelligent Model Router (Not Diamond/RouteLLM)** and **Story 3.1: Implement Automatic Retries for LLM Calls**. It also relies on **Epic 1** for foundational LLM access.

- **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI. The fallback mechanism will primarily be implemented within the `intelligent-router` service.

- **Failure Detection:** The mechanism for detecting provider failure needs careful consideration. This could be based on consecutive timeouts, specific error codes, or explicit health check endpoints (if providers offer them).

- **Routing Logic Refinement:** The router's decision process will become more complex, incorporating health status and fallback configurations.

- **Observability:** Comprehensive logging and alerting for fallbacks and failures are essential for operational insights. Refer to "Centralized Logging," "Monitoring & Metrics Collection," and "Alerting" guidelines in the Architecture Document.

- **Error Handling:** Ensure that errors from both primary and fallback providers are handled gracefully, as per the "Error Handling Strategy".

- **Idempotency:** Consider whether LLM requests are idempotent for retries and fallbacks. Most LLM calls are effectively idempotent from the gateway's perspective (sending the same prompt expects the same response).
