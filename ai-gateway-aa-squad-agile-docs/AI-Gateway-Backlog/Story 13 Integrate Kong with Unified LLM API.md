# Story 1.3: Integrate Kong with Unified LLM API

## Status: Draft

## Story

*   As a **developer**,

*   I want to **configure Kong to route LLM requests to the unified LLM API (Portkey/LiteLLM)**,

*   so that **all external LLM traffic passes through Kong's management layer to the unified LLM interface**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1.  Kong is configured to proxy LLM-related requests to the `unified-llm-api` service.

2.  An external request sent through Kong successfully reaches an LLM provider via the `unified-llm-api` service and returns a valid response.

3.  Kong's rate limiting, configured in Story 1.1, applies correctly to the proxied LLM requests.

4.  Kong's initial security configurations (e.g., API key authentication), configured in Story 1.1, apply correctly to the proxied LLM requests.

5.  The integration adheres to the Python and TypeScript coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

6.  Local testability: An external API call through Kong can be verified using command-line tools (e.g., `curl`) from the local development environment, demonstrating end-to-end connectivity.

## Tasks / Subtasks

*   [ ] Ensure the `unified-llm-api` service (from Story 1.2) is deployed and accessible to Kong (e.g., within the same Docker network or Kubernetes cluster).

*   [ ] Define a Kong Service pointing to the `unified-llm-api` service.

*   [ ] Define a Kong Route that matches incoming LLM request paths (e.g., `/llm/v1/chat/completions`) and associates it with the new Kong Service.

*   [ ] Verify that Kong successfully proxies requests to the `unified-llm-api` service.

*   [ ] Test that Kong's rate limiting (from Story 1.1) correctly applies to requests routed to the `unified-llm-api`.

*   [ ] Test that Kong's API key authentication (from Story 1.1) correctly secures access to the LLM endpoints.

*   [ ] Write unit tests for the Kong configurations (if using declarative config) to verify routing rules.

*   [ ] Document the Kong Service and Route configurations in the Kong service directory's README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story is the capstone for Epic 1, connecting the external gateway with the internal LLM handling logic. Focus on seamless proxying and ensuring all of Kong's management features apply correctly.

*   **Dependencies:** This story **depends on Story 1.1: Set Up Core API Gateway (Kong)** (for Kong deployment and basic setup) and **Story 1.2: Implement Unified LLM API (Portkey/LiteLLM)** (for the internal LLM service).

*   **Technology Stack:** Kong (API Gateway), and the chosen unified LLM API (Portkey/LiteLLM) running as the upstream service. Python (FastAPI recommended) for the `unified-llm-api` service.

*   **Network Configuration:** Ensure proper network connectivity and name resolution between Kong and the `unified-llm-api` service, especially within a containerized or orchestrated environment (Docker, Kubernetes, Kuma). Refer to "Infrastructure Requirements" in the Architecture Document.

*   **Security:** Verify that Kong's security measures (authentication, rate limiting) from Story 1.1 are correctly applied to the LLM traffic. Adhere to "API Security (General)" in the Architecture Document.

*   **Error Handling:** Observe how errors from the `unified-llm-api` service are proxied back through Kong. Ensure they are handled gracefully and don't expose internal details, as per the "Error Handling Strategy".

*   **Testing:** End-to-end testing from an external client through Kong to an LLM provider via the unified API. Test both successful calls and scenarios where Kong's rate limits/authentication are triggered.
