# Story 5.1: Implement Prompt Template Management

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **create, store, and manage reusable prompt templates within the AI Gateway**,

- so that **I can standardize common LLM interactions and ensure consistency across different applications**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A dedicated storage mechanism (e.g., PostgreSQL database table `prompt_templates`) is set up for prompt templates.

2. Users can define and save named prompt templates through a dedicated interface (e.g., via a new API endpoint in `services/prompt-virtual-keys-service/` or the dashboard UI).

3. Templates support placeholders for dynamic content insertion (e.g., `{variable_name}`).

4. The gateway's services (e.g., Unified LLM API, Intelligent Router) can retrieve a specified template by name/ID and apply it to a raw prompt, correctly replacing placeholders.

5. Templates can be updated (e.g., by ID) and support versioning for backward compatibility.

6. The implementation adheres to the Python and TypeScript coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: A simple script or CLI command can create, retrieve, and apply a test prompt template, demonstrating placeholder replacement.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Design the `prompt_templates` database schema (referencing `prompt_templates` data model in Architecture Document).

- [ ] Implement database interaction (CRUD operations) for prompt templates within the `services/prompt-virtual-keys-service/`.

- [ ] Develop an API endpoint(s) for prompt template management (create, retrieve, update, delete).

- [ ] Implement logic within the `services/prompt-virtual-keys-service/` to handle placeholder replacement within template strings.

- [ ] Integrate prompt template retrieval and application logic into the `unified-llm-api` service.

- [ ] Ensure template updates support versioning requirements.

- [ ] Write unit tests for prompt template CRUD operations and placeholder replacement logic.

- [ ] Create a simple test script or CLI command to demonstrate prompt template management and application.

- [ ] Document prompt template API endpoints and usage in the `services/prompt-virtual-keys-service/` README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story lays the groundwork for powerful prompt management, ensuring consistency and reusability for LLM interactions.

- **Dependencies:** This story relies on the core gateway services (e.g., Unified LLM API from Epic 1) for consuming the templates. It also relies on the PostgreSQL database from the Architecture Document.

- **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI for the backend service. PostgreSQL for data persistence.

- **Data Models:** Refer to the `PromptTemplate` data model in the Architecture Document for the schema.

- **API Design:** Design clear and RESTful API endpoints for prompt template management, adhering to the "API Design and Standards" in the Architecture Document.

- **Prompt Interpolation:** The placeholder replacement mechanism should be robust and handle various cases, including missing placeholders gracefully.

- **Version Management:** The versioning requirement for templates is critical. Consider how this will impact retrieval and application (e.g., default to latest, allow specific version request).

- **Security:** Ensure secure handling of prompt content, adhering to "Data Protection" and "Input Sanitization/Validation" in the Architecture Document.
