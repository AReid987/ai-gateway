# Story 4.3: Implement Distributed Tracing for LLM Requests

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **implement end-to-end distributed tracing across all gateway components for LLM requests**,

- so that **I can visualize the full path of a request and pinpoint bottlenecks or failures within the system**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. Each LLM request generates a unique trace ID that propagates across Kong, the Unified LLM API, the Intelligent Router, and the Optimization Service.

2. Spans are created for significant operations within each component (e.g., Kong routing, Unified LLM API call, Intelligent Router decision, Optimization Service processing).

3. Trace data includes relevant attributes for filtering and analysis (e.g., model chosen, latency for each span, status, virtual key ID).

4. The tracing data can be exported to a compatible tracing system (e.g., Jaeger, OpenTelemetry collector) for visualization.

5. The implementation adheres to the Python and TypeScript coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

6. Local testability: A local trace viewer or console output can show the propagation of a trace ID and its associated spans across a test request.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Research and select a distributed tracing library/framework (e.g., OpenTelemetry SDK for Python, Kong's tracing plugins).

- [ ] Configure Kong to generate and propagate trace IDs for incoming requests.

- [ ] Instrument the `unified-llm-api` service to receive and propagate trace IDs, and create spans for its operations.

- [ ] Instrument the `intelligent-router` service to receive and propagate trace IDs, and create spans for its routing decisions.

- [ ] Instrument the `optimization-service` to receive and propagate trace IDs, and create spans for its optimization processing.

- [ ] Ensure all services correctly propagate trace IDs to downstream services and external LLM providers (if supported by provider API).

- [ ] Configure exporters to send trace data to a compatible tracing system (e.g., a local Jaeger instance for development).

- [ ] Write unit tests for trace ID propagation and span creation within each service.

- [ ] Create a simple test script to demonstrate end-to-end tracing for a sample LLM request.

- [ ] Document tracing configuration and how to view traces in the relevant service READMEs.

## Dev Technical Guidance

Distributed tracing is essential for debugging complex distributed systems and understanding request flows.

- **Dependencies:** This story builds on the services implemented in Epic 1, 2, and 3. It complements Story 4.1 (Centralized Logging) and Story 4.2 (Monitoring & Metrics Collection).

- **Technology Stack:** Python, FastAPI. Utilize OpenTelemetry SDK for instrumentation across Python services. Explore Kong's native tracing capabilities.

- **Trace Context Propagation:** Ensure consistent context propagation (e.g., W3C Trace Context headers) between services.

- **Observability:** This is a core component of "Epic 4: Observability & Analytics Dashboard." The collected trace data will feed into the dashboard. Refer to "Monitoring & Observability" in the Architecture Document for guidance on tracing.

- **Performance Impact:** Instrumentation should be lightweight and not introduce significant overhead.
