# Story 2.2: Develop Cost & Performance Optimization Rules

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **define and apply rules for optimizing LLM selection based on cost and performance**,

- so that **the gateway prioritizes cheaper or faster models for specific tasks when appropriate**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. A mechanism is implemented within the `intelligent-router` service to configure cost and performance metrics for each LLM model.

2. The intelligent router (from Story 2.1) successfully utilizes these configured metrics to inform its routing decisions.

3. Demonstrate a scenario where a low-complexity task (e.g., simple summarization) is routed to a cheaper/faster model.

4. Demonstrate a scenario where a high-complexity task (e.g., detailed analysis) is routed to a potentially more capable, possibly more expensive, model.

5. The routing decision logs (from Story 2.1) are enhanced to include the specific cost/performance rules applied and the rationale for the model selected.

6. The implementation adheres to the Python coding standards defined in the Architecture Document.

7. Local testability: A test utility or script can be run to simulate requests and verify that the router applies the cost/performance rules correctly in its model selection.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Define a schema or configuration structure for storing cost (e.g., price per token) and performance (e.g., average latency) metrics for various LLM models.

- [ ] Implement a mechanism to load or configure these metrics within the `intelligent-router` service.

- [ ] Modify the routing logic (developed in Story 2.1) to incorporate cost and performance as primary decision factors.

- [ ] Develop test cases to verify that models are selected based on the configured cost/performance rules.

- [ ] Update the logging mechanism to include details about cost/performance rule application in each routing decision log entry.

- [ ] Write unit tests for the new routing logic incorporating cost/performance rules.

- [ ] Document how to configure and update the cost/performance rules within the `intelligent-router` service README.

## Dev Technical Guidance

This story refines the intelligence of the gateway by introducing explicit cost and performance considerations into the routing logic.

- **Dependencies:** This story **depends on Story 2.1: Implement Core Intelligent Model Router (Not Diamond/RouteLLM)**.

- **Technology Stack:** The chosen router (Not Diamond or RouteLLM) and Python with FastAPI.

- **Configuration Management:** Consider how these cost and performance metrics will be stored. They could be hardcoded for MVP, fetched from a database (PostgreSQL is available), or loaded from a configuration file.

- **Routing Logic Refinement:** The complexity of the routing logic will increase. Ensure the code remains modular and testable, allowing for future expansion (e.g., A/B testing routing strategies).

- **Observability Impact:** The enhancement of routing decision logs is critical for validating the effectiveness of these rules. Refer to "Observability & Analytics Dashboard" Epic in PRD and "Logging" in Architecture Document.

- **Performance:** The routing decision itself should remain fast and not introduce significant latency.
