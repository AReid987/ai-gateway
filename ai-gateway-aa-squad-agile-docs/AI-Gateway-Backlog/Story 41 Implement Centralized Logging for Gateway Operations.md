# Story 4.1: Implement Centralized Logging for Gateway Operations

## Status: Draft

## Story

- As a **developer**,

- I want to **ensure all AI Gateway operations (requests, responses, errors, routing decisions) are centrally logged**,

- so that **I can effectively troubleshoot issues and gain insights into system behavior**.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

1. All components of the AI Gateway (Kong, Unified LLM API, Intelligent Router, Optimization Service) emit structured logs.

2. Logs include relevant contextual information (e.g., request ID, timestamp, LLM provider used, model name, response status, latency, cost, tokens used, error messages).

3. Logs are directed to a centralized logging system (e.g., file-based logs initially, with a path for integration into a log management service).

4. Error logs clearly indicate the source and nature of the failure (e.g., LLM provider error, gateway internal error, specific component failure).

5. Sensitive information (e.g., raw API keys, PII from prompts/responses) is strictly excluded or masked from logs.

6. The implementation adheres to the Python coding standards defined in the Architecture Document, specifically for logging.

7. Local testability: Logs can be viewed from a local console or log file, and demonstrate structured format and contextual information.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Configure structured logging (JSON format) within each Python backend service (Unified LLM API, Intelligent Router, Optimization Service).

- [ ] Ensure Kong's logging is configured for structured output and can be collected.

- [ ] Implement consistent log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL) across all services.

- [ ] Add logic to include correlation IDs (request IDs) in all log entries for end-to-end traceability.

- [ ] Implement mechanisms to sanitize or mask sensitive data (API keys, PII) before logging.

- [ ] Direct logs to a common output (e.g., standard output for container logs, or a shared log volume).

- [ ] Write unit tests for logging utilities to ensure correct log formatting and data masking.

- [ ] Document logging configuration and how to access logs in the respective service READMEs.

## Dev Technical Guidance

Centralized logging is the backbone of observability. Focus on consistency, structure, and security of log data.

- **Dependencies:** This story implicitly relies on all core gateway services (from Epic 1, 2, 3) for their operational data.

- **Technology Stack:** Python's standard `logging` module (configured for JSON format), Kong's logging capabilities. FastAPI services.

- **Error Handling:** Logging plays a critical role in the "Error Handling Strategy" outlined in the Architecture Document.

- **Observability:** This story is foundational for "Epic 4: Observability & Analytics Dashboard." Ensure logs are parsable and rich with context for future dashboard integration. Refer to "Monitoring & Observability" in the Architecture Document.

- **Security:** Adhere strictly to "Security Best Practices" for sensitive data handling in logs.
